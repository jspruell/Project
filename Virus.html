		<h2>Viruses and Data Recovery</h2>
			<p>These are the common problems which hard drive incur. We have a consistent and reliable background in DATA recovery with dedicated equipment and facilities.</p>
		<h2>Does this Sound Familiar?</h2>
			<p>It all started with a Windows crash. The blue-screen occurred literally from the blue sky. After rebooting and trying to open a Word document I was working on, I’ve got a corrupted file. There wasn’t much text typed, so I simply created a new one and went on.</p>

			<p>However, the problem persisted. I started getting intermittent crashes every once in a while, every time with more and more corruption. Running scandisk found and recovered multiple ‘lost’ chunks that were essentially useless. What’s worse, I started seeing ‘bad’ sectors in the scandisk reports. Slowly, I began realizing that there might be something wrong with the hard disk.</p>

		<h2>Dont continue, Call us!</h2>
			<p>If you have deleted some information and need to get it back, DO NOT USE YOUR SYSTEM until we can come and take a look. Deleting data doesn't mean it's gone, it just means it can't been seen. If you have deleted something then stop and get some help. If you continue to use your system in the hopes of getting it back later, this could prevent data recovery as you might over-write the deleted files with newly saved files. By not using the system and by not saving any new files, it makes recovering deleted information much easier and more probable.</p>
